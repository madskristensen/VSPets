## 🙏 Acknowledgements

This extension was inspired by [VS Code Pets](https://tonybaloney.github.io/vscode-pets/) by [Anthony Shaw (tonybaloney)](https://github.com/tonybaloney). VS Code Pets is a fantastic extension that brings pets to VS Code's explorer panel with throwable balls and themed backgrounds.

VS Pets takes a different approach—pets walk along the Visual Studio status bar and react to your builds. Double-click any pet to throw a ball and watch them chase it!
